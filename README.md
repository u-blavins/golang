## Notes

*Advantages of Go for server side programming*

- Simple Syntax: syntax is simple and concise, not bloated with unnecessary features.
- Easy to write concurrent programs: Concurrency is an inherent part of the language - writing multithreaded progras is a piece of cake.

*Intermediate concepts of Go*

Go uses flexible `for` and `switch` loops. There are also new control structures, such as type switch and `select.

> `if-else`: this construct tests for a conditional statement - logical or boolean.
> `switch-case`: structure is used instead of long `if` statements that compare variables to values.
